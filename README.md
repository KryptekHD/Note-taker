# Note-taker

##Description
The purpose of this project was to creat a place where you can add events along with a description about it  and it will save these to a data base that holds all of them. these events that you create will be displayed to the left of the of the area where you can see all of them layed out for you.Along with this all the notes will be saved even if you leave the webpage. through out the course of doing this project there were many thing that I needed to do in order to complet this. the first thing was to figure out what packages that i wanted to use along with understanding how all the information can be pulled from each of the datbase. along with this there was a lot of refferencing that i had to do to my notes in order to figure out how everything would work together.
